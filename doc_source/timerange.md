## Historical Time Range Options<a name="timerangeref"></a>

In Cost Explorer, months are defined as calendar months\. Days are defined as 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM\. Based on these definitions, when you choose **Last 3 Months** for a date range, you see cost data for three previous months, not including the present month\. For example, if you view your chart on June 6, 2017 and select **Last 3 Months**, your chart includes data for March, April, and May 2017\. All times are in Universal Coordinated Time \(UTC\)\. 

You can choose time ranges for both your past costs and your forecasted future costs\.
