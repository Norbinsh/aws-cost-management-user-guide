# Using Preconfigured Reports<a name="preconfigreports"></a>

Cost Explorer provides preconfigured views that are designed to give you at\-a\-glance visibility into your costs and usage\. You can use these views to quickly identify unusual costs, and then you can customize the view to investigate in more detail\. 

The preconfigured views display charts based on fixed filter settings\. They provide quick access to information that is most commonly useful to an organization\. All the preconfigured views display a chart\. Under the chart, the page shows a *data table* that displays the cost figures that were used to create the chart\. You can also download a CSV report that contains the line items that are used to generate the views\.

Preconfigured views are available for monthly and daily time ranges\. If you use the consolidated billing feature, you have the option to view member accounts in a monthly time\-range format\. You access the preconfigured reports by using the **Reports** drop down in the Billing and Cost Management console\. 

For more information about how the chart displays services and how the data table displays cost figures, see [Reading the Cost Explorer Chart](aboutchart.md) and [Reading the Cost Explorer Data Table](aboutdatatable.md), respectively\. 

**To open the preconfigured reports**

1. Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Cost Explorer**\.

1. On the Cost Explorer page, choose **Launch Cost Explorer**\.

In all the preconfigured views, a data table below the chart displays the actual figures that were used to generate the chart\. 

**Note**  
Charges for your current billing period shown on these reports are estimated\. Estimated charges shown on this page, or shown on any notifications that we send to you, may differ from your actual charges for this statement period\. This is because estimated charges presented on this page do not include usage charges accrued during this statement period after the date you view this page\. One\-time fees and subscription charges are assessed separately from usage and recurring charges, on the date that they occur\.
